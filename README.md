### 🚀 About Me

- I’m a student and a developer who loves learning through hands-on experience, especially with AI.
- I often build projects with AI even if I don’t fully understand them at first—because I believe learning happens best during the process!
- I thrive on challenges and am always curious to try something new.

### 🛠️ Skills & Projects

- I’m not “officially” skilled in any specific tech yet, but I know how to make AI work for me and learn as I go.
- Many of my early projects were lost before I could finish them, but each one taught me something valuable.
- I use AI tools efficiently to overcome obstacles and create cool stuff.

### ⚡ Hobbies & Interests

- Skating, drawing, and playing sports of all kinds—if it’s active, I’m in!
- I love taking care of kids in the park so their parents can relax and enjoy themselves.
- I’m great with children and bring plenty of energy and fun to every activity.
- I’m very athletic and always ready for new adventures.

### 🌱 Always Learning

- My journey is about growth, curiosity, and making the most out of every experience.
- If you have a challenge or a project, count me in—I’m ready to learn and give it my best!
